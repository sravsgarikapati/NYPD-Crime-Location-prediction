    "<p> The Crime Prediction is one of the important topics in recent years that aims to help make the job easier for the police. We have chosen the complaint data, which is published by the New York police department (NYPD), to reflect every felony, misdemeanor, and violation crime that has taken place in New York City so far this year (2022). We decided to dig deeper into the data to see if there are any underlying patterns or relationships that could explain the reasons for the high crime rate in New York City. For this project, we plan to build a model that predicts the possible crime locations and the suspects based on the historic data. This model can be helpful in suggesting areas and schedules for patrolling.</p>"

    "<p>There has been previous research done on similar scenarios. In one of the studies, various clustering algorithms, including K-Means clustering and agglomerative clustering, were examined and applied to the Stop, Question, and Frisk Report Database of the NYPD, in order to analyze crime locations and detain people in an effort to lower city crime rates. The K-Means algorithm performed better in clustering, according to the analytical and visual results [1]. In another study, crime is investigated using qualitative and quantitative approaches. It includes looking into theft, homicide, and various drug offenses, as well as strange behaviors, noise complaints, and burglar alarms. Crime rates for each category of crime and cities with high crime rates have been identified using the K-means clustering data mining approach on a crime dataset from the New South Wales region of Australia[2]. One more research study attempted to quantify the degree of crime distortion in order to fill a major gap in the existing CompStat literature. The purpose of its study is to use multinomial logistic regression and semiparametric group-based trajectory modeling to detect and describe any precinct-level patterns of probable crime distortion.
